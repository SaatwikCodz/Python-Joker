# Python-Joker,
This is a discord bot which is actively being added features to,
This Bot is Running 24/7,
Me, as the developer am not willing to spend money so I hosted this bot in DISCLOUD,
If you host the bot in any other service, then you don't need the discloud.config,
Remember to replace the value in the .env file with your personal TOKEN for discord application,
Remember to change your ID in the discloud.config to your own application id,
To test the bot by yourself join "https://discord.gg/ncj9WrUec8"
This bot is being attempted to be invited to many big servers,
Thank You,
-- Dev (Saatwik)
